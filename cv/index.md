### About me 
I am a biologist at heart (and formal training), with the mindset of a tinkerer-engineer. I
like to study animal behaviour with a combination of experimental, theoretical and technology-driven
methods. The field of bat echolocation allows me to do exactly that. In my daily life as a PhD student I
handle animals, signal processing, thermal cameras and use lots of Python code to glue them all
together. I am especially interested in interdisciplinary approaches to answer questions.

### Education 

**2015-present** : ​ PhD investigating how echolocating bats are able to cope with acoustically difficult
situations. I use a combination of theoretical and experimental approaches to tackle this question.
Supervisor: Dr. Holger Goerlitz, Acoustic and Functional Ecology Group, Max Planck Institute for
Ornithology, Seewiesen.

**2008-2013**: ​ BS-MS dual degree in Biological Sciences, Indian Institute of Science Education and Research,
Thiruvananthapuram (IISER-TVM)

Masters Thesis in the School of Biology: ​ *Task differentiation during prey capture and retreat-mate
recognition in the Indian social spider, Stegodyphus sarasinorum (Eresidae)*. Supervisor: Dr. Hema
Somanathan

Minor project in the School of Physics: ​ *In silico modelling of auxin driven phyllotaxis*. Supervisor: Dr. Anil
Shaji
