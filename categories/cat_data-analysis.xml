that's over five years in the making now. The code in the manuscript
itself reflects the need for mutiple coding platforms and how each of them 
bring its own superpowers with it. All of the image analysis results in the project
has been done in MATLAB. The stats and analyses have been executed and documented
in R with Markdown notebooks. A collaborator did some additional analyses in 
MATLAB recently and sent over some new results. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would have all been fine, and I probably  wouldn't have even written the post if &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://thejasvibr.github.io/blog/2_universal_data_formats/"&gt;Read more…&lt;/a&gt; (2 min remaining to read)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><guid>https://thejasvibr.github.io/blog/2_universal_data_formats/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 09 Apr 2020 07:27:00 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
