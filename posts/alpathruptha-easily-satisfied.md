description: On why less is more in research sometimes.

This post begins with the seemingly unrelated topic of  gaming, and then finds its way into
topics somewhat related to science and research. It is kind of a weakness
of mine to spawn sub-stories from stories. Within every project that's started
there is a sub project waiting to burst out. This time I decided to 
let the sub-story/project out for a little walk. 

Almost over half a decade ago, I was still in college/university and busy training my 
future scientist-self in the art of collaboration through evenings filled
with a whole bunch of multi-player games run through a LAN splitter we'd bought at the hostel.
It was incredible fun playing these games with a bunch  of people after 
a long day filled with technical blah blah and what not, and it'd basically be 
everyone in our hostel playing various games in teams. 

Despite the fact that I really liked playing these games, especially 
while playing strategy games, it turned out I really *sucked*. The problem 
was that we'd often play in teams,  and  so the people in my team would often
suffer quite a bit thanks to  my incompetence :P. It won't be surprising 
to know now that I also sucked at playing non-strategy games, and was
especially bad at first-person shooters. My thresholds were low, and 
I was extremely happy whenever the most basic things worked out. In 
a first person shooter, this meant not dying. In the strategy games, this
meant not being invaded and all of my hard word being taken over by  someone from the other team. 

A friend of mine, (somewhat irritatedly), of course commented on this 
by calling me an *'alpathruptha'*, and that phrase has somehow remained with me to date. *Alpathruptha* is a sanskrit word
(and used in other Indian languages) that means someone who is 
easily satisfied, with minimal desires, and the lot.
