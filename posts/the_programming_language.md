When it comes to choice  of  programming language to get any task done,  people can sometimes have strong opinions. <!-- TEASER-END -->
I've seen tweets from authors reporting reviewers who wanted the stats/plots/something done in R, and being dismissive of it 
being done in any  other language. This is truly ridiculous, and this kind of attitude amounts to a weird, unhealthy kind 
of gate-keeping. What will come next, oh the code is only  compatible with a Windows OS, it should have been developed keeping 
a Unix OS in mind...or even more specific comments about which packages to use?

The point is, there is a feeling some members of the community have that certain computational tasks are well suited to be done 
with *insert favouriteprogramminglanguage*. I find this attitude absurd and take it to be a form of irrational favoritism. If 
a piece of code is not in a coding language I use regularly, the only thing it means is that I may  not be familiar  with 
a whole bunch of cool concepts and ideas that the authors use. It doesn't mean the work is sub-standard. This argument cuts 
both ways, whether the language is an open-source or proprietary platform. If anything at all, if I have to read code written 
in an unfamiliar language and understand it - it needs to be well-documented! The user/reader needs  to understand what  is 
happening in the code irrespective of the actual for and while loops running under the hood.


Documenting code well is not a trivial task,  and not something which can be done well over a couple of days. The closest task to documenting a codebase
 is writing a (scientific) manuscript. Things keep changing, you realise a bunch of things over a series of iterations, and 
even then there may be details lying around from the time you actually created the manuscript file itself. 

So, okay, the programming language maketh not the science. A well-documented codebase is more capable of convincing an
audience of its own utility and accuracy.
