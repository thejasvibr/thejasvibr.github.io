<p>Almost over half a decade ago, I was still in college/university and busy training my 
future scientist-self in the art of collaboration through evenings filled
with multi-player games run through a LAN splitter we'd bought at the hostel.
It was incredible fun playing these games with a bunch  of people after 
a long day filled with technical blah blah and what not, and it'd basically be 
everyone in our hostel playing various games in teams. </p>
<p>Despite the fact that I really liked playing these games, especially 
while playing strategy games, it turned out I really <em>sucked</em>. The problem 
was that we'd often play in teams,  and  so the people in my team would
suffer quite a bit thanks to  my incompetence :P. It won't be surprising 
to know now that I also sucked at playing non-strategy games, and was
especially bad at first-person shooters. My thresholds for satisfaction were low,
 and I was extremely happy whenever the most basic things worked out. In 
a first person shooter, this meant not dying. In the strategy games, this
meant not being invaded and all of my hard word being taken over by  someone
 from the other team. Yes, I had (very) high expectations of myself.</p>
<p>A friend of mine, (with a mix of concern and irritation), of course commented on this characeteristic of mine
by calling me an <em>'alpathruptha'</em>, and that phrase has somehow remained with me for a long time. <em>Alpathruptha</em>, is a sanskrit word
(and used at least in Kannada) that used to describe someone who is easily satisfied, with minimal desires, and the lot<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>. The way my friend meant it, 
it could also be interpreted as someone without ambition. While I may be an <em>alpatrupta</em>
 in certain parts of life, I constantly struggle with being dissatisfied with the progress in a project
or where it is at right now.  </p>
<p>The origin of this flashback to the word now fail me, but it somehow lead me 
to think about how in some ways the more of an <em>alpathrutha</em> one is, the 
better it might be while doing research. Especially while handling a new topic
or technical method, perhaps less is better? In some ways being thrilled at 
having survived the day, is a gret incentive for coming back the next day. Getting
into a new topic is always tricky for me.<br>
Celebrating the small wins like they say. </p>
