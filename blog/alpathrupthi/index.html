<p><em>original post: 05/20, edits in 04/21</em></p>
<p>Almost over half a decade ago, I was still in college/university and busy training my 
future scientist-self in the art of collaboration through evenings filled
with multi-player games. </p>
<p>Despite the fact that I really liked playing these games, it turned out I really ....<em>sucked</em>.
My hand-eye coordination was too bad for fast paced first-person shooter games, and my sense of 
strategy for real-time strategy games was inadequate, to say the least. The problem 
was that we'd often play in teams,  and  so the people in my team would
suffer quite a bit thanks to  my incompetence :P. The main issue: my thresholds for satisfaction were low,
 and I was extremely happy whenever the most basic things worked out. In 
a first person shooter, this meant not dying and my ultimate strategy was to indiscrimately spray everything with bullets. In the strategy games, this
meant not being invaded, or succeeding in a minor takeover of a neighbouring village. On top of that, I was in many ways like the proverbial frog 
in boiling water. Many real-time strategy games require you to keep check of your kingdom's finances, labour power etc. I could never notice my kingdom
failing, and would ask for a loan from my team-mates after it was too late. Also, I never got better through the two years that we played :p. No matter
how badly we lost, I'd still be happy with something insignificant that had happened in the game. </p>
<p>On one of these evenings, a friend of mine finally expressed his frustration and amusement by by calling me an <em>'alpathruptha'</em>, and that phrase has somehow remained with me for a long time. <em>Alpathruptha</em>, is a sanskrit word
(also used in Kannada) that describes someone who is easily satisfied, or with low ambition <sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>. My dear friend was
of course strongly focussing on my utter lack of drive and ambition. While I may be an <em>alpathruptha</em>
 in certain parts of life, I constantly struggle with being dissatisfied with the progress in a project
or where it is at right now.</p>
<p>The origin of this flashback to the word now fail me, but it somehow lead me 
to think about how in some ways the more of an <em>alpathrutha</em> one is, the 
better it might be while doing research. Especially while handling a new topic
or technical method, perhaps less is better? In some ways being thrilled at 
having survived the day, is a great incentive for coming back the next day.</p>
<p>Considering how a lot of research in the initial phases is two steps front, ten steps back, a sense of <em>alpathrupthi</em> is only appropriate perhaps. 
Perhaps it's also important to celebrate the realisation of failure. When you realise something is wrong with the code/equipment/results, maybe it should be 
considered an achievement in itself. Of course some might argue, this is nothing but <em>alpathrupthi</em> embodified, you decide. </p>

<li id="fn:1">
<p><em>alpathruptha</em> also has the other more ascetically associated meanings: without great desire, one with low
expectations or easily satisfied. <a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text">↩</a></p>
