#### Hello!

Hello, and welcome to the first post of my blog. This is where I'm planning to write about science and scientific computing. This is a somewhat informal venue
to discuss some ideas, <!--TEASER_END--> and so even though most of the ideas are not mine - do not expect formal citations for many things!

#### Why?
Why am I throwing all these words onto the internet. Isn't the internet filled with enough people who are already talking and writing about all kinds of 
specialised topics? Yes, it is, and that's kind of exactly what academia is too. A lot of people writing and discussing very specialised topics, with tiny audiences :P. 
I'm writing mainly to clarify some of the thoughts/ideas for myself, and hopefully any reader with the patience and curiosity to stick around. 

#### How?
Like many things computer-related I've done, this site and blog was built through a Python package, Nikola. The link to the package is in the page footer.
