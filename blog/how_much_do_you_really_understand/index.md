Title: So, how much do you really understand about (cool) topic X? (also, it's not you who's dumb, find the right source/teacher)

Working in academia can be quite stressful. Handling the uncertainty  of where you'll be in the next few years, and whether you're competent enough at all
(impostor syndrome). Even once you assume you've understood something, five minutes later another thing'll come up to show that the mental model you had 
was actually rather wrong. It can be very frustrating to put in a lot of effort, assume success, and then back to square one.<!-- TEASER_END --> But  that is the life of an academic grappling with new topics, themes and approaches all the time. Even if you don't switch your own field of research, trying to keep up with
what's happening around in conferences and journals means being able to catch the idea being presented, at least in broad strokes. Learning new concepts is
hard, especially when it's thrown at you for the first time over the span of a few pages in a paper and a few minutes in a talk. 

Even though I may have the curiosity to pursue a subject or topic after hearing/reading about it somewhere, I often find strong historical and disciplinary 
barriers to my entry. For instance, while working on the [measure-CFFM calls]() package, I realised (again) the main way I was trying to separate two types
of sound would work 75% of the time, but would fail horribly  the other 25% of the time. Luckily, it wasn't so hard to find an alternative method because
signal processing is a vast field with applications in all kinds of situations. Excited, I started downloading seemingly relevant papers, and books to try 
and figure out whether this method could be applied at all onto the bat calls or not. The first barrier is disciplinary. Opening up a book filled with proofs
of convergence or homology, or such things doesn't quite help. While I may have felt underconfident about  not understanding the equations in the page, 
now I'm able to skim through the whole text without worrying about the details in the equations. If I missed something important, it'll probably be there in 
another text too! The second barrier is historical. Especially since this seemed to be a rather niche method mainly applied in the signal processing and 
some fields of physics, there were no non-mathematically driven explanations. I'm happy to handle math when it's presented with more context around it, but 
independently it's quite a struggle. Despite the abundance nice equation-loaded LaTex pdfs and slideshows,there are always crumbs of information to be picked up
on the go. I learnt the method's useful, but can be hard to interpret, and was the basis for a bunch of newer methods X, Y and Z. Now, that's not bad huh?

So what do you do when you're trying to understand a niche topic filled with foreign terms and steeped in its own historical context? Honestly speaking, all
fields of science are like this, and I guess the only thing to do is to shop around resources until you find the one that 'speaks' to you, whether it's a Youtube
video, a MOOC lecture, or a conversation with a colleague. The fact is, when you're new to a field  or trying to get into it, blaming yourself for not understanding
is counter-productive. If I'm arrive in a foreign country and someone starts talking to me in the language of the land, I do not feel stupid about not understanding, 
but am quick to realise it. It;s not you  who's dumb, there's a right source/teacher waiting for you at the level you are at right now - find it!
