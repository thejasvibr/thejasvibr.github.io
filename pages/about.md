I'm a behavioural and sensory biologist interested in studying how animals do the crazy things they do.
Some of the animals I've studied (and am studying) are social spiders, bats, and...plants. I like to mix behavioural observations, sensory measurements, modelling and technology with
lots of  Python code everywhere and understand more about the how and why of animal behaviour.

Thanks for landing up here, and do check  out the other pages about my research, publications, and my blog where I write mostly about 
science and scientific computing.

### *Updates*
* I'm currently heading on the path to finishing up my PhD, and am looking for potential labs to do a post-doc. I'm particularly interested in projects that involve a mix 
of computational and experimental components to it with sensory biology and image/signal analysis involved. I'd also be interested to talk about the possibility of continuing
work on a high spatio-temporal resolution dataset of echolocating bat groups I collected  during my PhD. Visit [this page](../usho-visho) for more details on why I think this dataset is cool and unique!
