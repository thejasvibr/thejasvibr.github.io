* ### My [Github profile](https://github.com/thejasvibr)

* ### Reproducible code
In the recent past I've been trying to make as much of the actual data crunching, analysis and visualisation as computationally reproducible as possible. This means avoiding steps which include clicks with a mouse, or manual copy-pasting of files.
In the Python ecosystem, it is incredibly easy to do this using the rich package system and Jupyter notebooks. The first paper from my PhD was a computational  model of bat echolocation in groups, and 
the essential parts of the paper (results, analysis and  plots) can be independently recreated by running a couple of files.
Check it out  [here](https://github.com/thejasvibr/the_cocktail_party_nightmare).

* ### Python packages
In the context of quantifying horseshoe bat calls I've been working on a Python package to identify and segment sounds based on their frequency modulation. *Stay tuned for more!!*

* ### Android apps with Kivy
Smartphones are everywhere and I've always been curious to start playing around with them, and may be use them for a research project at some point. Using the [Kivy](https://kivy.org/#home)
Python package I've recently been playing around and making small (and rather trivial) apps. Check out these repos and try them out yourself: [screenbash](https://github.com/thejasvibr/screenbash), [youscrolled](https://github.com/thejasvibr/youscrolled).
