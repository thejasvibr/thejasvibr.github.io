I'm a behavioural and sensory biologist interested in studying how animals do the crazy things they do.
Some of the animals I've studied (and am studying) are social spiders, bats, and...plants. I like to mix behavioural observations, sensory measurements, modelling and technology with
lots of  Python code everywhere to understand more about the how and why of animal behaviour.

Thanks for landing up here, and do check  out the other pages about my research, publications, and my blog where I write mostly about 
science and scientific computing.

### *Updates*
* Online PhD defence scheduled on 10/6/2021!
* New social spider manuscript accepted from an old 2015 project. Oh the relief. ([read about some issues I faced dealing with analyses done by *pastme*](../blog/finish-this-analysis/)).
* Newly started as post-doc at the [Centre for the Advanced Study of Collective Behaviour](https://www.exc.uni-konstanz.de/collective-behaviour/). I'll be working with an interdisciplinary team on the [Ushichka dataset](../ushichka).
