I'm a behavioural and sensory biologist interested in studying how animals do the crazy things they do.
Some of the animals I've studied (and am studying) are social spiders, bats, and...plants. I like to mix behavioural observations, sensory measurements, modelling and technology with
lots of  Python code everywhere to understand more about the how and why of animal behaviour.

Thanks for landing up here, and do check  out the other pages about my research, publications, and my blog where I write mostly about 
science and scientific computing.
