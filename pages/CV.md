### About me 
I am a biologist at heart (and formal training), with the mindset of a tinkerer-engineer. I
like to study animal behaviour with a combination of experimental, theoretical and technology-driven
methods. The field of bat echolocation allows me to do exactly that. In my daily life as a postdoc I
watch animals, signal processing, thermal cameras and use lots of Python code to glue them all
together.

### Work experience
**2022 August - present** : DFG Walter Benjamin postdoc grant holder - awarded for the grant 'The How and What of Active Sensing Collectives'

**2022 March - 2022 June** : Young Scholar Fund Bridge Fellowship to continue work started at the CASCB, Uni Konstanz

**2021 March - 2022 March** : Postdoc grant at the Centre for the Advanced Study Collective Behaviour to develop tracking methods and analyse the 
[Ushichka dataset](../ushichka). 

**2015-2021** : ​ PhD investigating how echolocating bats are able to cope with acoustically difficult
situations. I use a combination of theoretical and experimental approaches to tackle this question.
Supervisor: Dr. Holger Goerlitz, Acoustic and Functional Ecology Group, Max Planck Institute for
Ornithology, Seewiesen.
