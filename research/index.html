<h2>The cocktail party nightmare : how do groups of bats echolocate?</h2>
<p>Echolocating bats emit very loud calls and listen for the faint
returning echoes to figure out where things are. This works
pretty  well when they're flying alone, but when in a group
things might start to get very tricky. Each bat in a group emits very loud
calls about ten times per second. Every bat in the group is also
trying to listen for its own (faint)  echoes in the midst of all the
loud sounds (calls and echoes) from their neighbours.</p>
<p>Even though we think of it as a challenging situation (the cocktail party nightmare),
many bat species don't seem to be bothered by it. Bats are very social animals
and even display impressive feats of group flight as they emerge in the evening
or even within the cave itself.</p>
<img alt="../images/orlova_chuka.gif" src="../images/orlova_chuka.gif" style="height: 15pc;"><p>My research seeks to answer how they manage to fly despite the tricky
sensory conditions. I use computational sensory modelling along with
experimental observations with video-acoustic tracking to quantify
the sensory  inputs a bat in a group might be receiving. In a recent <a class="reference external" href="https://www.pnas.org/content/116/52/26662.short">paper</a> we showed that even though echolocation does get harder with increasing group sizes, bats
may still be detecting at least one echo per call. I also performed video and acoustic
tracking of bats as they echolocated in their caves. While the hardware technology
to do this has been in place for some time now, it's only recently that the
signal-processing and tracking methods are coming into place. I'm looking
forward to analyse the one-of-a-kind <a class="reference external" href="../usho-visho">dataset</a> of which the GIF above is just a tiny part of!</p>

<div class="section" id="social-spiders-task-division-and-web-construction">
<h2>Social spiders : task division and web construction</h2>
<p>Most spiders are actually very asocial. If you were to put two spiders in a
box, at the end of the day you'd typicallly have just one of them alive. In contrast
to the 'classic' spider way of doing things, there are just about 40 species of
spiders that are positively social. Two social spiders  in a box will actually end up in the same corner at the end of the day. As a result of their sociality social spiders can do many things a typical solitary spider cannot. A nice example is that social spiders can build <em>huge</em> webs, or capture prey much larger than
they would be able to alone.</p>
<img alt="../images/stegos_on_web.gif" src="../images/stegos_on_web.gif" style="height: 15pc;"><img alt="../images/stego_ppt.png" src="../images/stego_ppt.png" style="height: 15pc;"><p>Despite their coolness as spiders, they have been relatively under-studied. For
instance, even though they live in groups, it wasn't quite clear if social
spider groups individuals were task specialised, as in some honey bee and
ant species. Moreover, all spiders in a group look the same. We looked at
whether there was individual propensities to capture prey and participate
in web maintenance and building and saw that there were indeed spiders
that consistently participated more in prey-capture, but that this could
be modulated by hunger-levels. Later on, I was part of an inter-disciplinary team that looked
at how social spider webs develop over time.</p>

<div class="section" id="plant-phyllotaxis-where-do-leaves-end-up-growing">
<h2>Plant phyllotaxis: where  do leaves end up growing?</h2>
<p>Plant leaves and flowers can be arranged in very cool patterns. A really
nice intricate pattern is the <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanesco_broccoli">romanesco broccoli</a>. This pattern of leaf/stem placement
in a plant is called phyllotaxis. These patterns have of course fascinated many
people over the past few centuries, and more recently experimental and computational work has shown that new leaves begin
to grow wherever plant hormones, called auxins accumulate. This was my first encounter with hands-on computational modelling. Of course, my own modelling didn't work out so well back then, but I was lucky enough to contribute to a review paper on the recent methods and results in the experimental and computational
fields of phyllotaxis.</p>
